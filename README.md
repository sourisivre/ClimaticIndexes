# ClimaticIndexes
Download climatic indexes values from NOAA and perform monthly correlation between them.

This code was developed in order to provide data for a PhD course final work around 2020.

## Fluxogram
1. You have a list of [Climatic Indexes](https://github.com/sourisivre/ClimaticIndexes/blob/main/files/iURL.txt) here called `iURL.txt`. In this file there are abreviation and online repository of those indexes;
2. You download them and check for inconsistencies, such as zeros and null values;
3. Now you intersect the range of time where those monthly data are simultaneously avaiable;
4. Finally, you create a matrix of correlation between them in multiple aproaches.
